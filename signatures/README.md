This folder accompanies the following manuscript:
- William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma. (2017). [Limitations of proposed signatures of Bayesian confidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/13/218222).

[figs.ipynb](./figs.ipynb) generates the figures used in the manuscript, but the notebook mostly contains plotting code.
It calls functions in [signatures.py](./signatures.py), which is where you should look if you're interested in seeing how confidence is computed, etc.
