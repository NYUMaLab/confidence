This folder accompanies the following manuscript:

- William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma. (2018). [Limitations of proposed signatures of Bayesian confidence](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco_a_01141?journalCode=neco) [[pdf]](http://www.wtadler.com/papers/Adler2018.pdf). *Neural Computation.*

[figs.ipynb](./figs.ipynb) generates the figures used in the manuscript, but the notebook mostly contains plotting code.
It calls functions in [signatures.py](./signatures.py), which is where you should look if you're interested in seeing how confidence is computed, etc.
