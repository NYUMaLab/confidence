If you want to explore model fits, try filling this folder with the .mat files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13PCbl8IQg7tsL49F1o-t0RuI-818BXTb?usp=sharing). Be warned that these are 11 files averaging about 600MB. They're big because they include the thinned chains of samples generated when we fit the models with MCMC.
