# Are human confidence reports Bayesian?
This repository accompanies three manuscripts on the topic of whether human confidence reports are Bayesian. The following manuscripts, by [Will Adler](http://wtadler.com), [Rachel Denison](http://racheldenison.com), [Marisa Carrasco](https://psych.nyu.edu/carrasco/), and [Wei Ji Ma](http://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/), are in submission with preprints available on bioRxiv:
1. William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma. (2016). [Human confidence reports account for sensory uncertainty but in a non-Bayesian way](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/18/093203).
2. Rachel N. Denison, William T. Adler, Marisa Carrasco, Wei Ji Ma. (2017). [Humans flexibly incorporate attention-dependent uncertainty into perceptual decisions and confidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/10/175075).
3. William T. Adler, Wei Ji Ma. (2017). [Limitations of proposed signatures of Bayesian confidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/13/218222).

This repository includes the [human subject data](human_data) and the code used for fitting and comparing the models reported in papers 1 and 2. We will soon post detailed instructions on how to replicate our results.

The repository also includes the code used to produce the [simulations](signatures) reported in paper 3.
