# The computations underlying human confidence reports are probabilistic, but not Bayesian
This repository accompanies a manuscript (preprint available on [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/12/11/093203)), by William T. Adler and Wei Ji Ma. It includes the human subject data and the code used for fitting and comparing the models reported in the paper.

We will soon post detailed instructions on how to replicate the results in the manuscript.
